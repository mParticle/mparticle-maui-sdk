# Currently this workflow does not automatically pull in changes from development or create a git tag or Github "Release". First 
# make sure to manually create a release commit in main branch updating the version number in the `mparticle.nuspec` file.
# Then run this workflow from main branch to build and release to nuget. After it's released to nuget, manually create a tag 
# and Github "Release" in the public repo pointing to the release commit.
